### And me?
I am a student, have been a student for many, many years. The Covid-19 pandemic means I had time to dabble in website building.  
What I have learnt from this experience? That I cannot build my own website alone and **need** help from templates.  
I like to think that with time I can make it better. Meanwhile, enjoy my journey through the bioiformatics jungle.
