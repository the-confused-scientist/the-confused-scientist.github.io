I have always enjoyed wet lab work. From my incessant pursuing of instilling a biology/chemistry lab course during my last two years of high school, to my biochemistry bachelor with various wet laboratory courses and my research masters that I am on currently, I have always chosen the more literal hands-on approach.

This means I have not properly prepared myself for todayâ€™s situation: the world is ending, and I have to do a computer-based internship. The project is exciting, the method is interesting, and the supervisor is great and always willing to help. What is the problem? I am extremely inexperienced in anything to do with bioinformatics or computers.

So, I have to start from the beginning.

This blog is a way for me to keep track of things I learn and things I find interesting, in a way for all of us (me, myself, I and the imaginary reader) to really grasp what we are trying to achieve in science using bioinformatics and genomics.
