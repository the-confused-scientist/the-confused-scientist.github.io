I will start with a little story, most of you even know how this one goes. Once upon a time a bat contracted a coronavirus, some other animal ate it and somehow it ended up in the human population. This virus slowly took over our entire world in about 2 (TWO) months and it is still running the show today. It got the name of Covid-19 and an attitude fit to rule the world, i.e. humans are a means to an end (Trump knows a bit about this... _don't worry this is not a political website but I assume very few people will read this and therefore I will sometimes share my political frustrations_). Slowly of course, the virus has become a bit of us that we can't seem to shake and the Netherlands at least is returning to **normal**.

Sure, life can return to some semblance of normality but _start of complaining piece_ my internship was cancelled. Yes, there are worse things in the world. Yes, I understand that you, _the reader? my subconcious? my multiple personalities?_, don't actually care. My internship was going to be on growing **mini-brains** in the laboratory, **do you see why I am complaining about it being cancelled yet?** Maybe you just don't care about this and love genetics more (_assuming that's why you're here_). I have yet to find my love for it but I am hoping that through this series of blogs I will at least understand it enough to _drum roll_ start (and complete) my replacement internship project, which is on genetics. **WOOO!**

The project itself is not for this website ofcourse, but using it as a general example, I will try to explain GWAS uses because I have found a deficit in the market for such information. [gif of frantic searching on the web?]

The journey into 'GWAS' - I know what it is defined as, I know what the results look like and I now know that it is 'snips' not 'S.N.P.s'. Fantastic I'd say but definitely not close to enough.

### Let's start with G - this stands for 'Genome' but I like to think of it as the '...'
