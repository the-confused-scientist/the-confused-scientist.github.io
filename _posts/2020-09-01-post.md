“The confused scientist” is a first attempt at a blog, that I assume will be looked at by my family and maybe friends. It is a story of a young researcher attempting to navigate the world of science, programming, adulthood and currently the pandemic. I am the confused scientist because, to be put plainly, am confused. And I know I am not alone.

The current world of constant opportunity, limitless higher education, and the sheer amount of papers published every year make most young researchers at least a little anxious. I am one of the many students who have pursued an academic career with not enough understanding as to what that entails. This is my journey and I guess a bit of a self-help book for the procrastinating high achievers out there.
