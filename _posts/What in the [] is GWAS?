Genome Wide Association Studies: what the [_insert choice of profanity_] are they?
This might come off a little agressive, I know... but GWAS and beyond has been haunting me now for two months, but I have avoided it for much longer. I know what it is defined as, I know what the results look like and I now know that it is 'snips' not 'S.N.P.s'. Fantastic I'd say but definitely not close to enough.

So together, we can take the journey into 'GWAS'.
