Have you, like me, fallen into a well of confusion as to how best study a protein or region of interest? This is a[n incomplete] tutorial on the best tools I have come accross, what they can do for you and how best to utilise them.


**Tool** | **Details** | **Best use**

[GTEx portal](https://gtexportal.org/) | Genotype-Tissue Expression Portal, this project aimed to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible | One use is for identifying gene and exon expressions most common in different tissue types; using this fro identification of which part of a protein sequence I want to focus on to make primers for analysis
[Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/) | Ensembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation | 
[UCSC - Europe](https://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/) |  |
